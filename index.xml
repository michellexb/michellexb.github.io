      <description>INTRO As many data scientists and programmers have said, R and Python may be 2 of them most useful languages to know. Similarly, politicians and businessmen say that English and Chinese are the 2 most useful languages to learn. But of course it is difficult to become fluent in both- especially since they are 2 of the most difficult languages both grammar- and vocabulary-wise. This is the same for R and Python.</description>

Michelle Bao - MB57592 - Project 2 0) Introduction # This &amp;quot;Cervical Cancer Risk Factors for Biopsy&amp;quot; dataset was obtained thanks to UCI Repository. I chose this dataset because I currently work at a ob/gyn clinic and my passion for women&amp;#39;s health is what initially motivated me to pursue a medical career. Additionally, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers. The original dataset contained 858 observations and 36 columns.</description>
